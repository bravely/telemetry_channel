telemetry_channel
====

telemetry_channel is a type-safe typescript toolkit for data mapping and language integrated query. It uses [Kysely](https://github.com/kysely-org/kysely) and is inspired by Elixir's [Ecto](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.html), to provide a more functional and type-safe way to interact with databases.

## Installation

**NPM**
```bash
npm install telemetry_channel
```
